# minesweeper

To run, use python shell command on minesweeperAgent.py:

python minesweeperAgent.py

Edit minesweeperAgent.py static variables to set number of games, number of mines, and the size of the square board.

Our oracle refers to Bai Li's Minesweeper AI: https://github.com/luckytoilet/MSolver. His algorithm has been translated into python and modified to fit our game configuration. Further tweaks have been made to his algorithm to improve runtime and solution generation.

Our baseline refers to a simple Minesweeper AI solver that considers only single tiles to determine mine locations and guesses a random tile when it has exhausted possible options.

For further information on our algorithm, read the report.pdf file included in the repository.
